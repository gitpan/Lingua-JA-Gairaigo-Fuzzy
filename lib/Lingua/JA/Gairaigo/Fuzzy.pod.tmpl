=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Lingua::JA::Gairaigo::Fuzzy 'same_gairaigo';

word.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 same_gairaigo

    my $same = same_gairaigo ('メイン', 'メーン');

This guesses whether the two words are the same. It catches things
like addition and removal of "ー", "・", "ッ", as well as the mixing
of elements such as "ティ", "テー", "テイ", and "テ". If the two words
appear to be the same, it returns a true value. If the two words
appear not to be the same, it returns a false value.

=head1 CAVEAT

Because this module is intended to deal with natural language, it does
not guarantee to find a correct answer. Bug reports containing test
cases are very much appreciated.
